TEMPEST

SYNOPSIS
     python server.py [port]
     python client.py [host:port]

DESCRIPTION
     Tempest is a lightweight multi-room chat server and client inspired by
     classic BBS systems and early IRC. The server maintains multiple chat
     rooms with in-memory message history and real-time distribution.

     The server runs on port 1991 by default and accepts multiple concurrent
     TCP connections. Each client connects using a simple text-based protocol
     and can join different chat rooms.

INSTALLATION
     Quick Install:
             curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janoelze/Tempest/main/install.sh | sh

     Or with wget:
             wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janoelze/Tempest/main/install.sh | sh

     The installer downloads the latest version from GitHub and installs
     system-wide commands. Requires curl or wget. Installs to ~/.local/bin
     which may need to be added to your PATH.

     Manual Installation:
             git clone https://github.com/janoelze/Tempest.git
